Hello my name is Pedro Linhares, I'm a full stack developer.
After finishing my high school I wanted to start a career in technology,
being passionate about programming since my 12th year,
my first project was a program made in python in which I put the program in my graphing calculator
(TEXAS TI-nspire CX II-T ) which helped me a lot in the subject of mathematics A.
I decided to join a bootcamp of 14 weeks of programming where I learned several technologies,
but the main ones are java and javascript. 
Personally I learned to program in other languages, such as swift, js, kotlin, C#, etc...
I decided to apply for the /// team because I know it is an excellent company,
I find the project plans very interesting and I know that I would be able to give the company a good performance
